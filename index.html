      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>A Navy veteran passionate about a smattering of topics, from gaming to sociology. 
        Coming from a career in the service industry and stepping into the world of tech for the first time,
      I am excited for new possibilites. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born July 22, 1993 and was raised in the Pocono Mountains.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Gaming is my number one hobby, but I also enjoy indulging in a new craft beer or wine now and again.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I am not yet sure what my dream job may be.  I know I want it to be one that I can be passionate about,
        not one that is just an endless cycle of punching the clock meaninglessly.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Pen Argyl, PA in an area known as the Slate Belt.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Jumping into the tech field as a career really seemed to click with me, and 
        I am looking to take it to the next level to advance in the field.</p>
